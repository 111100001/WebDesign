<h1>Camel_ids</h1>

<p>The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous.
     Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered 
     digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw.
     They have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still. (from Wikipedia)</p>
